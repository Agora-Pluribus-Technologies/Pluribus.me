# Pluribus.me

Web-based simple all-in-one website building and publishing tool

Let's democratize and de-Googlify the internet!

Static website generator

Oauth2 login to GitHub or GitLab for cloud storage of generated site source code

This repo is to be deployed on Cloudflare Pages.

The users site(s) are created, edited, and generated entirely in-browser and deployed to pluribus.me through the Cloudflare Pages function.

See the About page for more details on the file formats and folder structure: [about.md](about.md)

Neocities is a community where people make their own websites.
It acts like a bridging algorithm, since no one can comment on the pages directly,
and people can link each other's pages.

## TODO

### Image support
The application will be able to handle image uploads that convert to AVIF and supports image sizing and displays correctly on mobile

### Zip file download
The application will be able to generate a downloadable zip file containing the website source code that can be deployed to any number of site hosts:
* NeoCities (drag and drop files in the `public/` directory)
* Cloudflare Pages (link the GitHub or GitLab repository directly, or do a zip file upload)
* Netlify (link the GitHub or GitLab repository directly, or do a zip file upload)
* GitLab Pages (TODO: Add gitlab-ci.yml for GitLab Pages deployment)
