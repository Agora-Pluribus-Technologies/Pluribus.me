# Pluribus.me

Web-based simple all-in-one website building and publishing tool

Let's democratize and de-Googlify the internet!

Static website generator

Oauth2 login to various static site hosting services such as
* Neocities
* GitLab Pages
* GitHub Pages
* Cloudflare Pages
* Netlify

This repo is to be deployed on Cloudflare Pages.

The users site(s) are created, edited, and generated entirely in-browser and deployed to one or more services for redundancy.

See the OwO specification for more details on the file formats and folder structure: [owo.md](owo.md)

Neocities is a community where people make their own websites.
It acts like a bridging algorithm, since no one can comment on the pages directly,
and people can link each other's pages.

(Site not live yet, but will be deployed here)
