# AgoraPages

Web-based simple all-in-one website building and publishing tool

Let's democratize and de-Googlify the internet!

Static website generator

Oauth2 login to GitHub or GitLab for cloud storage of generated site source code

This repo is to be deployed on Cloudflare Pages.

The users site(s) are created, edited, and generated entirely in-browser and deployed to agorapages.com through the Cloudflare Pages function.

See the About page for more details on the file formats and folder structure: [about.md](about.md)

The idea is that it acts like a "human bridging algorithm," since no one can comment on the pages directly, and people can link each other's pages.
